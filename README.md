## 🚀 Features

### 🔹 1. Intent Classification Agent
Understands user intent such as:
refund, cancellation, billing issue, delivery issue, fraud report, login issue, general help, feedback.

### 🔹 2. Sentiment Analysis Agent
Detects emotional tone:
very_angry, frustrated, neutral, positive, very_positive.

### 🔹 3. Fraud Detection Agent
Interpretable risk scoring based on:
keywords, metadata, account age, IP mismatch, prior chargeback.

### 🔹 4. Reply Agent
Generates tone-adjusted, urgency-aware, fraud-sensitive responses.

### 🔹 5. Escalation Agent
Decides escalation:
normal queue / priority_support / fraud_team.

### 🔹 6. Memory System
Maintains short conversation history with timestamps.

## 🧩 System Pipeline (How It Works)

User Message
|
v
Intent Agent ─────► intent + urgency
|
v
Sentiment Agent ─► sentiment label + score
|
v
Fraud Agent ─────► fraud risk + reasons

v
Reply Agent ─────► AI-generated reply

## 📊 Example Output

```json
{
  "intent": "fraud_report",
  "sentiment": "very_angry",
  "fraud_risk": "high",
  "reply": "I completely understand how frustrating...",
  "escalation": {
     "escalate": true,
     "queue": "fraud_team"
  }
}

🏆 Why This Project Stands Out
Multi-agent design (rare in student projects)
Fraud detection + sentiment + escalation = enterprise workflow
Pure Python → easy to run anywhere
JSON-style structured outputs
Kaggle, GitHub, portfolio friendly

📌 Use Cases
Customer support bots
Fraud alert systems
Automated ticket triage
E-commerce complaint classification
Real-world AI workflow demos
